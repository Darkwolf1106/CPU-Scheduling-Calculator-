# CPU-Scheduling-Calculator-
Developed an interactive web-based tool to simulate and analyze CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin. Implemented JavaScript logic to calculate average waiting and turnaround times dynamically, with a responsive UI for visualizing process execution and scheduling results.

To run the CPU Scheduling Calculator, open the index.html file located in the public folder.
